**CyberGuard** is a Python-based GUI tool for cybersecurity enthusiasts and professionals. It analyzes password strength, estimates entropy, checks for breaches using the Have I Been Pwned API, generates strong passwords, and creates detailed reports. Ideal for portfolio projects, internships, and demonstrating practical security skills.

## Features

- **Password Strength Analysis**: Calculates entropy and strength level (Very Weak → Very Strong)  
- **Breach Detection**: Checks if a password has been exposed using the HIBP API  
- **Password Generator**: Generate strong passwords with configurable length (6–32 characters)  
- **Show/Hide Password**: Toggle password visibility for convenience  
- **Clipboard Support**: Copy and paste passwords easily  
- **Detailed Suggestions**: Provides actionable advice to strengthen passwords  
- **Report Generation**:  
  - Generates `.txt` and `.csv` reports in `reports/` folder  
  - Includes timestamp, entropy, strength, breach result, and input method
